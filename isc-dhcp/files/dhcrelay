# We need a method script for both IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP relays, because
# they both take strings of arguments of this form:
#
# -<letter> arg1 -<letter> arg2 ....
#
# For example:  -i e1000g0 -i e1000g1 ....
#
# Because you can't parse this out via SMF XML manifests, you must parse it
# out here, in a method script.
